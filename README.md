# SimpleHTTP
A simple multi-threaded implementation of a web server with support for websockets, intended for use on the RaspberryPi.

Full user guide to come upon code completion.

I work on this in my spare time so it's hard to pin down a completion date.

This project was intended to help further my understanding of C++ during my university course.
